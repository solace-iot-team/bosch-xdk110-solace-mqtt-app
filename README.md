# bosch-xdk110-solace-mqtt-app

## Overview
We have developed a **_reference mqtt client app_** for the Bosch XDK110 to demonstrate how a device can be programmed to interact with a wider IoT platform.

The XDK 110 is a programmable sensor. See details here: http://xdk.bosch-connectivity.com. "Iâ€™m a programmable sensor device & a prototyping platform for any IoT use case you can imagine."

The main features of the **_reference mqtt client app_** are:
- Configuration API - allows for a device management system to remotely configure the operations of the app
- Command API - allows to send commands to the app
- Status API - sends regular and ad-hoc status information
- Sampling & Telemetry API - sends configurable sensor readings at regular intervals
- Buttons API - sends a message when pressing / releasing a button

The software architecture:
